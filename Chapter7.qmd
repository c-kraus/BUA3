# Periodizing Success – The Annuity Method

> "Wealth is a snapshot. Income is a movie. The Annuity Method turns the snapshot into a movie."

In Chapter 4, we calculated the **Net Present Value (NPV)**. It told us: *"This project increases your wealth by € 50,000 today."*
That is great, but abstract. A CEO often asks: *"Okay, but what does that mean for my annual P&L? Can I afford to hire a manager for this project?"*

The **Annuity Method** (dt. *Annuitätenmethode*) answers this. It transforms the lump sum of wealth ($NPV$) into a constant annual stream of "excess profit".

It is the strategic twin of the **Annuity Loan** (from Chapter 3), just reversed.

## The Mirror Principle: Loan vs. Investment

To understand this method, look back at your notes from Chapter 3 (`Systematik der Kreditformen`).

* **In a Loan (Credit):** You get a pile of money today ($C_0$). You pay it back in constant slices ($Ann$). The bank calculates the annuity to get its money back plus interest.
* **In an Investment (Project):** You pay a pile of money today ($I_0$). The project pays *you* back in constant slices. You calculate the annuity to see if you get your money back plus interest.

**The Math is identical.** We use the **Capital Recovery Factor (CRF)** again.

$$Annuity = NPV \cdot \underbrace{\frac{i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n - 1}}_{CRF}$$

::: {.drag-exercise}
While the *Net Present Value* represents the total value created at time t=0, the *Annuity* distributes this value evenly over the *useful life* of the project. A positive annuity means the project earns *more* than the minimum interest rate.

## The Calculation: Converting Wealth to Income

Let's take a standard project.
* **NPV:** € 20,000
* **Duration ($n$):** 5 Years
* **Interest ($i$):** 10%

How much is this worth per year?
$$d = 20,000 \cdot \text{CRF}(10\%, 5) = 20,000 \cdot 0.2638 = \mathbf{5,276}$$

### Interpretation of "d"
What does this € 5,276 actually mean? This is vital for the exam.

1.  **The "Manager's Salary":** You could hire a project manager for € 5,276 per year. The project would pay her salary, earn the 10% interest for the bank, and break even.
2.  **The "Buffer":** Your annual cash flows could drop by exactly € 5,276, and the project would still be acceptable ($NPV=0$).
3.  **The "Super-Dividend":** If you distribute this amount to shareholders every year, the company's value remains constant.

#### Periodenerfolg (Annuity)
Unlike accounting profit (which fluctuates with depreciation), the Annuity is a calculated, constant "economic profit" distributed over the project's life. It includes the return OF capital (depreciation) and the return ON capital (interest).

## The Strategic Power: Comparing Apples and Oranges

The main reason we use the Annuity Method is **The Problem of Time**.
NPV is biased towards long projects.

**The Scenario:**
* **Project A (Short):** 3 Years. NPV = € 10,000.
* **Project B (Long):** 6 Years. NPV = € 15,000.

Is B better? Not necessarily. B ties up your capital twice as long. You cannot compare total wealth if the timeframes differ.
**Solution:** Compare the *annual* efficiency (Annuity).

* **Annuity A:** $10,000 \cdot \text{CRF}(10\%, 3) \approx 10,000 \cdot 0.402 = \mathbf{4,021\ \text{€}}$
* **Annuity B:** $15,000 \cdot \text{CRF}(10\%, 6) \approx 15,000 \cdot 0.229 = \mathbf{3,435\ \text{€}}$

**Verdict:** Project A is more efficient per year!
If you could repeat Project A (chain assumption), it would be the better choice.

> **Decision Rule:**
> If projects have different useful lives ($n_1 \neq n_2$), do **not** compare NPV. Compare Annuities! (Assuming the project can be repeated).

<summary>Deep Dive: The Infinite Chain (Kettenmethode)</summary>

Comparing annuities is mathematically identical to calculating the "Net Present Value of an Infinite Chain".
If you repeat Project A forever, and Project B forever, the one with the higher Annuity will generate a higher infinite NPV.
The Annuity Method is the shortcut for this complex calculation.

See how a "smaller" NPV can be "better" if the timeframe is shorter.

## 6.5 The Limits: When Math Lies

The Annuity Method relies on the **Reinvestment Assumption** (just like NPV) *PLUS* the **Repeatability Assumption**.

It assumes you can repeat the project at identical terms once it finishes.
* **Reality:** In 3 years, competitors might have copied your product, and the margins (Cash Flows) for the second round will be lower.
* **Risk:** If "Project A" was a unique opportunity (e.g., selling masks during a pandemic), the Annuity comparison is misleading. You should take the absolute wealth (NPV) of the longer project B if A cannot be repeated.

::: {.quick-check}
**You compare two machines. Machine X lasts 4 years, Machine Y lasts 8 years. Why is the Annuity Method better than NPV here?**

- It calculates the internal interest rate.
- It ignores the interest rate.
- **It normalizes the value to a yearly period, making different lifespans comparable.**
> Correct. It breaks the value down to a "common denominator" (1 Year).
:::

::: {.quick-check}
**If the Annuity (d) is exactly € 0.00, what is the NPV?**

- € 0.00
- Undefined
- Negative
> Correct. $d = NPV \cdot CRF$. Since the CRF is always positive, if $d=0$, then $NPV=0$.
