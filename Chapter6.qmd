# The Percentage Trap – Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

> "Percentages are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital."
> — *Prof. Burton Malkiel (adapted)*

Managers love percentages. "This project has a 25% return!" sounds much sexier than "This project has an NPV of € 4,200."
Enter the **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** (dt. *Interner Zinsfuß*).

While NPV measures the *magnitude* of wealth creation (Absolute Euros), IRR measures the *efficiency* of the capital employed (Relative Yield).
It answers the question: **"What is the maximum interest rate I could pay to the bank and still break even?"**

---

## The Definition: The Break-Even Rate

Mathematically, the IRR ($r$) is the specific discount rate at which the Net Present Value becomes exactly **zero**.
It is the x-intercept of the Capital Value Function ($C_0(i)$).

$$C_0 = -I_0 + \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t} \stackrel{!}{=} 0$$

If your calculation results in $NPV = 0$ using a discount rate of 12.5%, then 12.5% is your IRR.

### The Decision Rule (The Hurdle Rate)
You compare the project's internal power ($r$) against the external cost of capital ($i$, also called the *Hurdle Rate* or *WACC*).

| Scenario | Interpretation | Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$IRR > i$** | The project yields more than it costs. | **INVEST** (Go) |
| **$IRR = i$** | The project earns exactly the cost of capital. | **INDIFFERENT** |
| **$IRR < i$** | The project destroys value relative to the market. | **REJECT** (Stop) |

::: {.drag-exercise}
If the *Internal Rate of Return* is higher than the *market interest rate* (Hurdle Rate), the project creates value, and the Net Present Value is *positive*.

## The Calculation: Trial, Error & Interpolation

For a one-year project, calculating IRR is trivial.
For a multi-year project ($n > 2$), there is **no algebraic formula** to solve for $r$.
You face a polynomial equation of degree $n$.
We must approximate.

### 1. The Method of "Hard Staring" (Iteration)
You guess.
* Try 10% $\to$ NPV is positive. (Rate is too low).
* Try 15% $\to$ NPV is negative. (Rate is too high).
* The truth lies between 10% and 15%.

### 2. Linear Interpolation (Regula Falsi)
This is the standard examination method (see *Zimmermann*).
We assume the curve between two test points is a straight line (which is a lie, but a useful one).

$$r \approx i_1 + \frac{C_0(i_1)}{C_0(i_1) - C_0(i_2)} \cdot (i_2 - i_1)$$

* $i_1$: The lower interest rate (yielding positive NPV).
* $i_2$: The higher interest rate (yielding negative NPV).

<details>
<summary>Example: Calculating with Regula Falsi</summary>

**Project:** Invest -100, Return +110 in Year 2.
* **Trial 1 ($i_1=0\%$):** $NPV = -100 + 110 = +10$
* **Trial 2 ($i_2=10\%$):** $NPV = -100 + 110/1.1^2 \approx -9.09$

**Interpolation:**
$$r \approx 0\% + \frac{10}{10 - (-9.09)} \cdot (10\% - 0\%)$$
$$r \approx \frac{10}{19.09} \cdot 0.10 \approx 0.0523 = \mathbf{5.23\%}$$

*Real Answer:* $\sqrt{110/100} - 1 = 4.88\%$.
The approximation error exists because the NPV function is convex.

## The Fatal Flaw: The Reinvestment Reality Check

Here is where the "McKinsey" analysis kicks in. The IRR contains a hidden, technically dangerous assumption: **The Reinvestment Assumption (Wiederanlageprämisse).**

The math of the geometric series implicitly assumes that **all** intermediate cash flows ($CF_1, CF_2...$) are immediately reinvested **at the IRR itself**.

### Interactive Lab: The "Gold Mine" Illusion

Why is this dangerous? Imagine a project with a fantastic IRR of **50%**.
* **The Math Assumption:** The model assumes you take the cash flow from Year 1 and immediately find *another* project yielding 50% to put it into.
* **The Reality:** You probably put the cash into a bank account yielding 5% or pay off debt (costing 6%).

> **Crucial Insight:**
> The **NPV** method is honest: It assumes reinvestment at the market rate ($i$).
> The **IRR** method is optimistic: It assumes reinvestment at the internal rate ($r$).
> Therefore, IRR systematically **exaggerates** the wealth creation of highly profitable projects.

::: {.flip-card}
#### Baldwin Rate (Modified IRR)
A corrected version of the IRR (MIRR).
It explicitly calculates the future value of cash flows using the *realistic* Cost of Capital ($i$), not the utopian IRR.
It gives a lower, but honest percentage.

## Mathematical Anomalies: When Math Breaks

Sometimes, the IRR algorithm simply collapses.
This happens in "Non-Normal" investments.

### Descartes' Rule of Signs (Vorzeichenwechsel)
A normal investment has one sign change: Minus (Invest) $\to$ Plus (Returns).
This guarantees **one** unique IRR.
But what if you have to pay a huge disposal cost (nuclear plant cleanup) at the end?

**Profile:** $-100 \text{ (Invest)} \to +250 \text{ (Cash)} \to -160 \text{ (Cleanup)}$

Here, the sign changes **twice**.
**Result:** The NPV curve crosses the x-axis **twice**. You get **two IRRs** (e.g., 5% and 45%).
Which one is correct?
**Neither.** The method fails.

::: {.callout-warning}
### Management Advice
If your cash flow stream changes signs more than once (e.g., big maintenance costs in the middle), **never** use IRR.
Use NPV.

## The Ultimate Showdown: NPV vs. IRR

Now that we have explored the mechanics, we must address the fundamental philosophical rift in finance.
**NPV is about Wealth. IRR is about Efficiency.**

### 1. The Fundamental Difference
* **Net Present Value (NPV):** Measures the *absolute* value added in Dollars/Euros. It is the difference between the present value of inflows and outflows. A positive NPV literally means "The company is now richer."
* **Internal Rate of Return (IRR):** Measures the *relative* return speed (%). It is the break-even discount rate.

### 2. The Pros & Cons Matrix

| Feature | Net Present Value (NPV) | Internal Rate of Return (IRR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time Value of Money** | **Yes.** Discounts all flows to today. | **Yes.** Discounts all flows to today. |
| **Logic** | Maximizes *Absolute Wealth*. | Maximizes *Relative Efficiency*. |
| **Reinvestment** | **Realistic.** Assumes reinvestment at the Market Rate ($i$). | **Optimistic.** Assumes reinvestment at the (often high) IRR itself. |
| **Communication** | **Hard.** "We add € 4,235 to value." (Requires context). | **Easy.** "We make 25% return." (Managers love this). |
| **Math Stability** | Always one unique solution. | Can fail (Multiple IRRs) or break. |
| **Risk Adjustment** | Easy (adjust discount rate $i$). | No calculation adjustment (compared *ex-post* to $i$). |

### 3. The Conflict Zone: Mutually Exclusive Projects

This is the most dangerous trap in capital budgeting.
If you have to choose between Project A and Project B (you cannot do both), IRR and NPV might give you **contradictory signals**.

**The Scenario:**
* **Project A (Small & Fast):** Invest € 1, return € 1.50. **IRR = 50%**. NPV = € 0.40.
* **Project B (Big & Steady):** Invest € 1,000, return € 1,200. **IRR = 20%**. NPV = € 100.

**The Conflict:**
* IRR says: "Take Project A! 50% is huge!"
* NPV says: "Take Project B! You make € 100 instead of 40 cents."

> **The Verdict:**
> In mutually exclusive scenarios, **NPV always wins**.
> You cannot pay dividends or salaries with percentages. You pay them with absolute Euros. A 50% return on a 1 Euro investment is technically efficient, but economically irrelevant compared to the scale of Project B.

::: {.drag-exercise}
While the *Internal Rate of Return* is easier to communicate, the *Net Present Value* is theoretically superior because it maximizes absolute *wealth* and assumes a realistic *reinvestment* at market rates. In case of conflict, follow the *NPV*.

## Chapter Check

Can you spot the trap?

::: {.quick-check}
**Project A has an IRR of 25%, Project B has an IRR of 15%.
The Cost of Capital is 10%. Can we automatically say Project A is better?**

- Yes, 25% is clearly higher.
- **No, we must check the NPV (Scale Effect).**
- No, because Project A might have higher risk.

> Correct.
If Project A is very small (Invest 1€) and B is huge (Invest 1 Mio €), Project B creates more absolute wealth despite the lower percentage.
:::

::: {.quick-check}
**Why do we use the "Regula Falsi" method?**

- To calculate the exact IRR.
- **To approximate the IRR because an analytical solution is impossible for n > 2.**
- To correct the reinvestment assumption.

> Correct. It linearizes the curve to find an approximate root.
