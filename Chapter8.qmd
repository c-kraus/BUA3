# The Silent Partner – Investment Appraisal with Taxes

> "Logic clearly dictates that if you tax something, you get less of it. In finance, logic sometimes takes a holiday."

In the previous chapters, we lived in a paradise called "The Perfect Capital Market." No friction, no transaction costs, and certainly no taxes. In reality, the state is a **silent partner** in every project you undertake. It claims a share of your profits ($s$), but—and this is the twist—it also assumes a share of your costs.

This duality changes the game. It can turn bad projects into good ones (**Tax Shield**) and, under rare circumstances, make you wish for *higher* taxes (**Tax Paradox**).

We use the **Standard Model of Corporate Taxation** (Standardmodell nach Kruschwitz) to integrate this partner into our NPV calculation.

## The Mechanism: The Standard Model

How do we calculate NPV with taxes? We cannot simply subtract 30% from the final result. Taxes distort two dimensions of reality simultaneously:

1.  **The Cash Flows (Numerator):** The state takes a cut of the profit.
2.  **The Cost of Capital (Denominator):** The state subsidizes the debt.

### Step 1: Adjusting the Cash Flows
We must convert *Pre-Tax Cash Flow* into *Post-Tax Cash Flow*.
Crucial: You do not pay taxes on Cash Flow. You pay taxes on **Profit**.
Since Depreciation ($D_t$) is an expense but not a cash outflow, it acts as a tax reducer.

$$CF_{after} = CF_{before} - \text{Tax Payment}$$
$$\text{Tax Payment} = s \cdot (CF_{before} - D_t)$$

$$CF_{after} = CF_{before} \cdot (1-s) + D_t \cdot s$$

* $s$: Tax Rate (Steuersatz).
* $D_t$: Depreciation (Abschreibung).

#### Depreciation Tax Shield
The cash value of the taxes saved due to depreciation. Since depreciation lowers taxable income, every Euro depreciated saves you $s$ Euros in taxes. This is why companies love "accelerated depreciation" (Sonderabschreibung).
:::

### Step 2: Adjusting the Discount Rate
This is where the magic happens. Interest payments on debt are usually **tax-deductible** (operating expense). Dividends to shareholders are not (use of profit).
Therefore, taxes make debt cheaper.

$$i_{after} = i_{before} \cdot (1-s)$$

If your bank charges 10% interest and the tax rate is 30%, your **effective** cost of capital is only 7%. The state pays the other 3%.

## The Lever: The Tax Shield

Why do Private Equity firms load companies with debt? Because of the **Tax Shield**.
In a world with taxes, the value of a levered firm (with debt) is higher than the value of an unlevered firm (only equity), simply because the government subsidizes the interest payments.

**The Calculation Effect:**
By reducing the discount rate $i$ in the denominator, the Present Value of future cash flows **rises**.

::: {.drag-exercise}
In the Standard Model, taxes have two opposing effects: They reduce the *numerator* (Cash Flows) which lowers value, but they also reduce the *denominator* (Discount Rate) which *increases* value.

## The Anomaly: The Tax Paradox

Normally, we assume: **Taxes destroy value.** ($NPV_{after} < NPV_{before}$).
But mathematics has a sense of humor. Under specific conditions, a project that is unprofitable before taxes can become profitable **because** of taxes.

$$NPV_{before} < 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad NPV_{after} > 0$$

This is the **Tax Paradox** (Steuerparadoxon).

### The Tug-of-War (Tauziehen)
It is a battle between two forces:

1.  **The Volume Effect (Bad):** Taxes take away money from your cash flows.
    * Strength depends on profitability.
2.  **The Interest Effect (Good):** Taxes lower the discount rate ($i \cdot (1-s)$), making future cash flows more valuable today.
    * Strength depends on the interest level and timing.

**The Condition for the Paradox:**
The Paradox occurs if the **Interest Effect dominates the Volume Effect**. This happens when:
* Interest rates are **high** (strong lever on the denominator).
* Depreciation is **high/early** (shifting tax burdens to the future).

<summary>Deep Dive: The Inflation Connector</summary>
The tax paradox becomes even more likely under high inflation. Why? Because nominal interest rates rise with inflation. High nominal rates create a massive Tax Shield base, while the real value of the future tax payments is eroded by inflation.

## Interactive Lab: Triggering the Paradox

Imagine a marginal project. Move the **Tax Rate Slider** to the right.
* **Normal World:** As taxes rise, the green bar (NPV) shrinks.
* **Paradox World:** If you set Interest high (e.g., 12%), rising taxes suddenly make the bar grow!

## 7.5 Strategic Summary: How to Play the Game

As a manager, you cannot change the tax laws. But you can change your **Depreciation Policy** and your **Financing Structure**.

1.  **Maximize Debt:** Until the risk of bankruptcy outweighs the tax advantage (Trade-Off Theory).
2.  **Accelerate Depreciation:** Write off assets as fast as possible. This shifts tax payments into the future. Since money today is worth more than money tomorrow (TVM), this creates value.

> **Management Rule:** "A tax deferred is a tax saved." Always postpone tax payments if legal.

## Chapter Check

Do you understand the distortion field?

::: {.quick-check}
**How does the Standard Model adjust the discount rate?**

- It adds a risk premium.
- **It multiplies the market rate by (1 - tax rate).**
- It leaves the rate unchanged.
> Correct. This reflects the tax deductibility of interest (Tax Shield).
:::

::: {.quick-check}
**When is the Tax Paradox most likely to occur?**

- When interest rates are very low.
- **When interest rates are high and depreciation is high early on.**
- When the company makes a loss.
> Correct. High interest maximizes the leverage on the denominator (Interest Effect).

::: {.drag-exercise}
The *Tax Shield* describes the value increase resulting from the tax deductibility of *debt interest*. This effect can theoretically lead to the *Tax Paradox*, where an increase in tax rates leads to a *higher* Net Present Value.
