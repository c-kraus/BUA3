# The North Star – Net Present Value (NPV)

> "Profit is an opinion. Cash is a fact. Net Present Value is the truth."

If you only remember one concept from this entire university course, let it be this one. The **Net Present Value (NPV)** (dt. *Kapitalwert*) is not just a formula; it is the operating system of capitalism.

Accounting (HGB/IFRS) looks backwards to calculate what happened. NPV looks forward to calculate what *value* a decision creates **today**. It transforms a cloud of uncertain future cash flows into a single, hard currency number in your hand right now.

## The Philosophy: Fisher Separation

Before we touch a calculator, we must answer a philosophical question that plagued economists for centuries:
*"How can a manager make a decision that satisfies **all** shareholders, even if one shareholder wants to save for retirement and another wants to buy a Ferrari today?"*

The answer came from **Irving Fisher (1930)**. It is the foundation of modern corporate finance.

### The Theorem
In a perfect capital market, the **investment decision** (how a firm produces wealth) is completely separate from the **consumption decision** (when owners spend wealth).

1.  **The Manager's Job:** Maximize the Present Value of the firm ($PV$). Do not care about the shareholders' time preferences. Just make the pie as big as possible.
2.  **The Capital Market's Job:** Act as a "Time Machine".
    * The "Ferrari-Shareholder" borrows money against his future dividends.
    * The "Retirement-Shareholder" reinvests his dividends.

**Conclusion:** As long as the manager maximizes NPV, *every* shareholder is better off, regardless of their personal plans.

#### Fisher Separation Theorem
The principle states that in a perfect capital market, a firm's investment decisions are independent of the owners' consumption preferences. The bridge between production and consumption is the capital market interest rate.

## The Algorithm: Calculating Wealth

The NPV ($C_0$ or $KW$) measures the **absolute increase in wealth** generated by a project at time $t=0$.

### The Formula
$$NPV = -I_0 + \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1+i)^t} + \frac{L_n}{(1+i)^n}$$

* **$I_0$ (Investment):** The initial cash outflow (usually negative). The price tag of the project.
* **$CF_t$ (Cash Flows):** The future net cash inflows (Einzahlungsüberschüsse). Not "Profit", but Cash!
* **$L_n$ (Liquidation Value):** What you get for the scrap metal at the end.
* **$i$ (Discount Rate):** The crucial variable. It represents the **Opportunity Cost**.

<details>
<summary>Deep Dive: Origin of the Discount Rate</summary>

In the file *Ursprung des Kalkulationszinssatzes*, we learned that $i$ is not just a random number. It is the return of the **next best alternative**.
If you calculate with $i=10\%$, you are implicitly asking: *"Does this project beat an alternative investment that yields 10%?"*
</details>

::: {.drag-exercise}
The Net Present Value compares the internal return of a project with the *opportunity cost* of the capital market. If the NPV is positive, the project yields *more* than the required minimum rate of return.

## The Decision Rule: The Digital Yes/No

The beauty of NPV is its binary clarity. Unlike "strategic fit" or "gut feeling", NPV gives orders.

| NPV Result | Interpretation | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$NPV > 0$** | The project returns **more** than the cost of capital. You are creating value. | **INVEST** (Go) |
| **$NPV = 0$** | The project returns **exactly** the cost of capital. You are not getting richer, but you are paid for your risk. | **INDIFFERENT** (Go) |
| **$NPV < 0$** | The project returns **less** than the alternative. You are destroying capital relative to the market. | **REJECT** (Stop) |

> **Critical Concept:**
> A manager rejects a project with $NPV = -100$.
> Does this mean the project makes a loss? **No.**
> It means the project might still make a profit, but *less* profit than the alternative investment. In economics, earning less than the market is a loss.

## The Hidden Axiom: The Reinvestment Assumption

Here lies the most dangerous trap of the NPV model. Most managers overlook it.
When your project generates a cash flow of € 50,000 in Year 1, what happens to that money? Does it sit in a vault?

**No.** The model mathematically assumes that **every Euro flowing back is immediately reinvested** at exactly the discount rate $i$ (Cost of Capital).

* **Theory:** In a perfect capital market, you can always invest at the market rate.
* **Reality:** If the market rate drops, or if you simply leave the cash in a 0% bank account, the calculated NPV was too optimistic.

> **The Hard Truth:** The NPV is only accurate if the "Reinvestment Assumption" (Wiederanlageprämisse) holds true until the very end of the project.

<details>
<summary>Deep Dive: Why this differs from IRR</summary>
The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) assumes you can reinvest at the (often extremely high) project interest rate. The NPV is more conservative: it assumes you can only reinvest at the standard market rate ($i$). This makes NPV the safer metric for decision making.

## Visualizing Truth: The Capital Value Function

There is a relationship between interest rates and value. We call this the **NPV-Function** $NPV(i)$.

It is a non-linear curve that almost always slopes downwards. Why? Because higher interest rates "punish" future cash flows harder.

### The Anatomy of the Curve
Imagine plotting $NPV$ (Y-Axis) against Interest Rate $i$ (X-Axis).

1.  **The Y-Intercept ($i=0\%$):**
    If money costs nothing, the NPV is simply the sum of all raw cash flows minus investment. This is the maximum possible value.
    $$NPV_{max} = \sum CF_t - I_0$$

2.  **The Slope:**
    Long-term projects (e.g., a power plant) have a steep slope. They are extremely sensitive to interest rate hikes. Short-term projects are flatter.

3.  **The X-Intercept ($NPV=0$):**
    The specific interest rate where the curve crashes through the zero-line has a famous name: The **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**.

## Strategic Conflict: The Scale Problem

Sometimes, NPV disagrees with your gut feeling about "Return on Investment" (ROI).

**The Choice:**
* **Project A:** Invest € 1,000 $\to$ Return € 1,500 next year. (50% Return)
* **Project B:** Invest € 1,000,000 $\to$ Return € 1,200,000 next year. (20% Return)

If your cost of capital is 10%:
* $NPV_A = -1,000 + 1,500/1.10 = \mathbf{363}$
* $NPV_B = -1,000,000 + 1,200,000/1.10 = \mathbf{90,909}$

**The Verdict:** Project A is more "efficient", but Project B makes you rich. Since you cannot buy a Ferrari with percentages, **NPV wins**. It measures absolute wealth.

> **Management Rule:** In mutually exclusive decisions (Entweder-Oder), always pick the higher NPV, not the higher percentage return.

## Chapter Check

Are you ready to defend your project before the board?

::: {.quick-check}
**What happens to the NPV of a standard investment if the central bank raises interest rates?**

- It increases.
- It stays constant (because cash flows are fixed).
- **It decreases.**
> Correct. Higher $i$ means the denominator $(1+i)^t$ grows, shrinking the present value of future cash flows.
:::

::: {.quick-check}
**You calculate an NPV of € -5,000. Your boss says: "So we lose 5,000 Euros?" How do you correct him?**

- "Yes, exactly."
- **"No. We earn back our investment, but we miss our target return by € 5,000 (value gap)."**
- "No, it's just a tax effect."
> Correct. A negative NPV means you are destroying value *relative* to the capital market alternative. You might still make an accounting profit, but it's an economic loss.
:::

::: {.drag-exercise}
The Net Present Value assumes that all intermediate cash flows are *reinvested* at the *calculation interest rate*. This assumption is realistic in *perfect* capital markets but can be problematic in volatile environments.

#### Investment Decision

A cylindrical grinding machine for a municipal depot is to be purchased at a price of 500,000 EUR. By having its own cylindrical grinding shop, annual cash outflows of 250,000 EUR could be avoided, which previously had to be paid for external work. The annual operating and maintenance outflows for the own machine are estimated at 100,000 EUR in the first year. However, they increase by 10% from year to year. The grinding machine can probably be used for 5 years and then resold for 30,000 EUR.

Is the investment advantageous if the municipal investor expects an interest rate of 8% p.a.?


::: {.solution}
**Solution: Investment Decision**

A0 = 500,000 EUR; i = 8%; n = 5 years; Ln = 30,000 EUR

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Net Cash Flow (in EUR)**   -500,000   +150,000   +140,000   +129,000   +116,900   +133,590
  -------------------------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NPV = - 500,000 EUR + 150,000 EUR \* (1.08)^-1^ + 140,000 EUR \* (1.08)^-2^ + 129,000 EUR \* (1.08)^-3^ + 116,900 EUR \* (1.08)^-4^ + 133,590 EUR \* (1.08)^-5^ = 38,164 EUR

NPV is positive => The investment is worthwhile!
