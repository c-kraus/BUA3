# The Time Machine – Fundamentals of Interest & Discounting

> "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it."
> — *Attributed to Albert Einstein*

Time is the most brutal constraint in economics.
A dollar today is not a dollar tomorrow. Why? Because you could have spent it (consumption preference) or invested it (opportunity cost).
Financial mathematics is nothing more than the architecture of time—a set of tools to transport value from the present to the future (**Compounding**) and from the future back to the present (**Discounting**).
In this chapter, we build the engine of finance.

## The Logic of Time: Why Money Has a Price

Before we calculate, we must understand.
Why do banks pay you interest? It is not charity. It is the price of time.
If you lend money to a bank, you defer your ability to buy a Porsche today. This sacrifice requires compensation.
Economically, the interest rate ($i$) is composed of three layers:

1. **Risk-free rate:** The pure price of time (consumption deferral).
2. **Inflation premium:** Compensation for the loss of purchasing power.
3. **Risk premium:** Compensation for the danger that the borrower (even a bank) might default.

### The Trinity of Interest

* **Theory:** Liquidity Preference Theory (Keynes) suggests we prefer cash now over cash later.
* **Norm:** In legal terms (e.g., BGB in Germany), interest is the "fruit" (Fruchtziehung) of capital.
* **Practice:** In 2022, inflation in the Eurozone hit 10%.
If your savings account paid 0.5%, your *real* interest rate was negative.
You were paying the bank to hold your melting ice cubes.

::: {.quick-check}
**Inflation Check:**
Your bank offers you a **5%** nominal interest rate per year.
However, the current inflation rate is **7%**.
What is your approximate **real interest rate**?

- +2% (I am getting richer)
- **-2% (I am losing purchasing power)**
- 12% (Nominal + Inflation)

> **Calculation:**
> $$r \approx i_{nom} - \pi$$
> $$r \approx 5\% - 7\% = -2\%$$
> You are effectively paying the bank to hold your money while it loses value.

#### Opportunity Cost
The benefit foregone by choosing one alternative over another.
In finance, the opportunity cost of holding cash under your mattress is the interest you *could* have earned in a bond.

<summary><strong>Case Study: The Silent Heist – Inflation in Turkey</strong></summary>

<br>
<strong>The Scenario:</strong>
In 2022, the Turkish Lira was in freefall.
To stop people from converting Lira to Dollars, banks offered massive interest rates on savings accounts: **30% p.a.**
Sounds like a dream deal, right?
In Germany, you were getting 0.5% at the same time.

<strong>The Trap:</strong>
While the bank paid you 30% interest ($i$), the inflation rate ($\pi$) in Turkey hit **85%**.

<strong>The Math (Fisher Equation):</strong>
The approximate real interest rate ($r$) is calculated as:
$$r \approx i - \pi$$
$$r \approx 30\% - 85\% = -55\%$$

<strong>The Verdict:</strong>
If you kept your money in that "high yield" account, you didn't get rich.
You lost more than half of your purchasing power in a single year.

> **Managerial Insight:** Never look at the nominal rate alone. It is a vanity metric.
Only the *real* rate buys you bread (or Porsches).

## The Engine: Simple vs. Compound Interest

There are two ways to grow money.
One is linear (boring), the other is exponential (explosive).

### Simple Interest (The Linear Trap)

Simple interest is calculated *only* on the principal amount.
It ignores the interest you earned in the past. It’s like a tree that grows new branches but never grows leaves on those branches.

* $FV$: Future Value
* $PV$: Present Value
* $i$: Interest rate (decimal, e.g., 0.05)
* $n$: Number of periods

### Compound Interest (The Exponential Beast)

This is where the magic happens.
You earn interest on your interest. The "leaves" start growing their own branches.
The difference seems small at first but becomes gigantic over time. This is the **exponential effect**.

::: {.flip-card}
#### Calculation Challenge: Simple Interest
You invest **$100** at **10%** for **3 years** using **Simple Interest**. How much do you have?

**The Math:**
Interest is calculated only on the principal ($100$).
$$I = 100 \cdot 0.10 = 10 \text{ per year}$$
$$FV = 100 + (3 \cdot 10) = 130$$
:::

::: {.flip-card}
#### Calculation Challenge: Compound Interest
You invest **$100** at **10%** for **3 years** using **Compound Interest**. How much do you have?

**The Math:**
Interest is calculated on the principal *plus* accumulated interest.
$$FV = 100 \cdot (1.10)^3$$
$$FV = 100 \cdot 1.331 = 133.10$$
*Difference due to compounding: $3.10*
:::


> **The Rule of 72 (Mental Math Hack)**
> How long does it take to double your money?
> Divide 72 by the interest rate.
> * At 6% interest: $72 / 6 = 12$ years.
> * At 12% interest: $72 / 12 = 6$ years.

<summary><strong>Case Study: The $24 Empire – The Manhattan Paradox</strong></summary>

<br>
<strong>The Legend:</strong>
In 1626, Peter Minuit purchased the island of Manhattan from the Lenape people for trade goods valued at approximately **$24**.
Today, Manhattan real estate is worth trillions. Most people think Minuit made the deal of the millennium. But did he?

<strong>The Counter-Factual:</strong>
What if the Lenape had taken that $24 and invested it in a diversified bond portfolio paying a standard **6% interest** (compound), reinvested annually until today (approx. 400 years)?

<strong>The Calculation:</strong>
$$K_n = 24 \cdot (1.06)^{400}$$
$$K_n \approx 24 \cdot 13,200,000,000$$
$$K_n \approx 316 \text{ Billion Dollars}$$

<strong>The Verdict:</strong>
While Manhattan is valuable, the sheer force of a 6% exponential function over 4 centuries creates wealth that rivals the GDP of small nations.

> **Managerial Insight:** Time is the most potent lever in finance. You don't need a high return (6% is modest);
you need *endurance*.

::: {.drag-exercise}
In simple interest, capital grows *linearly*, meaning the absolute interest amount remains constant each year.
In compound interest, capital grows *exponentially*, because the interest is *reinvested* to generate further returns.

## Time Travel: Compounding and Discounting

In dynamic investment appraisal (Investitionsrechnung), we rarely care about how much money we *will* have (Future Value).
We care about what future money is worth *today* (Present Value).

Why? Because investment decisions are made **now**.
You pay the machine price today ($t=0$). You get the returns in the future ($t=1, \dots, n$).
To compare them, you must pull the future back into the present.

### The Operation: Discounting (Abzinsen)

This is the most critical formula in this course.
We simply rearrange the compound interest formula to solve for $PV$.

$$PV = \frac{FV}{(1+i)^n} = FV \cdot (1+i)^{-n}$$

The factor $(1+i)^{-n}$ is called the **Discount Factor** (Abzinsungsfaktor).
It is always smaller than 1 (assuming positive interest). It shrinks the future value down to its present equivalent.

* **Compounding (Aufzinsen):** Moving form $t_0 \to t_n$. Making values *larger*.
* **Discounting (Abzinsen):** Moving from $t_n \to t_0$. Making values *smaller*.

::: {.drag-exercise}
In the discounting formula $PV = \frac{FV}{(1+i)^n}$, the relationship works as follows:
If the interest rate ($i$) increases, the Present Value *decreases*, because the denominator becomes *larger*.
This means: High interest rates punish *distant* future cash flows more severely than near ones.

<summary><strong>Case Study: The $700 Million Illusion – Shohei Ohtani</strong></summary>

<br>
<strong>The Headline:</strong>
In December 2023, baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani signed the biggest contract in sports history with the LA Dodgers: **$700 million** for 10 years.
The media went wild. But financial analysts just smiled.

<strong>The Structure:</strong>
Ohtani does not get $70 million a year.
* He gets **$2 million** per year for 10 years.
* The remaining **$680 million** are deferred and paid out *after* the 10 years (from 2034 to 2043), without interest.

<strong>The Valuation (Discounting):</strong>
To find the *true* value of the contract today (Present Value), we must discount those future $680 million.
Assuming a discount rate of **5%** (inflation + opportunity cost):
A payment of $68 million in year 15 is worth only:
$$PV = \frac{68,000,000}{(1.05)^{15}} \approx 32,700,000$$

<strong>The Verdict:</strong>
The Net Present Value (NPV) of the "700 million" contract was estimated by the MLB players' union to be around **$460 million**.

> **Managerial Insight:** Ohtani gave the Dodgers a massive interest-free loan.
In Finance, the *timing* of the cash flow is just as important as the *amount*.

### Practical Example: The Lottery Choice

**Scenario:**
* **Option A:** € 1,000,000 cash today.
* **Option B:** € 1,100,000 in one year.

::: {.quick-check}
**Assume the interest rate is 15%. Which option should a rational "homo oeconomicus" choose?**

- Option B (More money is always better)
- **Option A (€ 1,000,000 today)**

> **The Calculation (Discounting Option B):**
> We must compare the values at the same point in time ($t=0$).
> $$PV_B = \frac{1,100,000}{1.15} \approx 956,521$$
> Since **€ 1,000,000 (Option A)** > **€ 956,521 (Option B)**, taking the cash today is rational.
> The high interest rate makes waiting "expensive".

<summary>Deep Dive: Day Count Conventions</summary>
In academic theory, we assume a year has 360 or 365 days seamlessly.
In banking practice (Norm), it's messy.

* **30/360 (German Method):** Every month has 30 days. Simple, but slightly inaccurate.
* **act/act (ICMA):** Actual days in the month / Actual days in the year. Used in Euro-government bonds.

For this course, unless specified, we assume $n$ in full years.

::: {.quick-check}
**You expect € 10,000 in 2 years.
The interest rate is 10%. What is the Present Value?**

* € 8,000
* **€ 8,264.46**
* € 12,100

> Calculation: $PV = 10,000 / (1.10)^2 = 8,264.46$.
